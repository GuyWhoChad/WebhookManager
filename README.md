# WebhookManager

Webhook controller is very easy to use, every button explains what it is supposed to do, so yeah.

Also install with the setup in an accessible directory, because it is not currently possible to create a windows shortcut on start menu automatically.
Run the WebhookController.exe file to execute the program.
